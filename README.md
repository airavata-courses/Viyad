# Weather Visualization UI

## Purpose

This Web Application is used for displaying weather visualizations to the user as per their request.

## How it works
Initially, user will login and enter My Reports Page where already existing reports of respective users are displayed.
User will go to create report page and try to click on the required radar to get the respective weather data.Further, if user wants to save the report/dashboard, they can click Save and the data will be saved in Persistence Db using persistence service api calls. This data will be fetched on my reports page so that user persistence is maintained.

All the API calls made in the UI are made through API Gateway which acts as a middleware between UI and all other microservices
