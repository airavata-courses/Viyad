# API- Gateway

## Purpose

This act as a middle layer between frontend and backend. 

## How it works

User will hit all end points to API-Gateway then API-Gateway will reroute all request and get the response from respective microservices.
 

## How to install and Execute

### Software Requirements

Node


### Execution Steps
1. execute git clone https://github.com/airavata-courses/Viyad.git

## Implementation

User will hit API gateway using 3006 port to execute all other microservices. But it will re route all microservices to their corresponding end points.
